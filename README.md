AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun) and its wrapper [quick-sharun](https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/Anylinux-AppImages/blob/main/useful-tools/quick-sharun.sh), which makes it easy and reliable to turn any binary into a portable package without using containers or similar tricks. 

**This AppImage bundles everything and it should work on any Linux distro, including old and musl-based ones.**

This AppImage doesn't require FUSE to run at all, thanks to the [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime).

This AppImage is also supplied with the seamless self-updater by default, so any updates to this application won't be missed.  
Self-updater doesn't run if AppImage managers like [am](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) or [soar](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar) exist, which manage AppImage integration and updates.

## Known quirks

- Search-provider integration works only on Gnome (same as upstream) & it depends on:
  - the desktop file being present (which AppImage managers like `soar` & `am` already take care of).  
    Desktop file needs to be named `org.gnome.Calculator.desktop` for it to work.  
    The only exception is the detection for desktop file `gnome-calculator-AM.desktop` in local directories, which is added as a support for `am` AppImage manager.
  - the `XDG_DATA_DIRS` variable having the `XDG_DATA_HOME` in path, which the AppImage will detect if not present + warn about & suggest the solution.
  - This operation won't be performed if search integration files already exist in `/usr/share/` or `/usr/local/share/`, as it's assumed that the packager and/or system-administrator already handled that integration to the system. Modifying `XDG_DATA_DIRS` in that case is not needed.
  - If you use the AppImage portable folders feature, those 2 files are made in host's `${HOME}`, which you can delete on app removal:
    - `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/gnome-shell/search-providers/org.gnome.Calculator-search-provider.ini`
    - `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/dbus-1/services/org.gnome.Calculator.SearchProvider.service`
  - When you click the search entry to copy the calculation result, it will copy it, but the notification about it won't show
- Help page only works if `gnome-help` or other similar `.page` viewer is installed on the host's system.  
Bundling the help page viewer in the AppImage would make it work everywhere, but it's both bad for the file size and [security](https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2025/04/15/dangerous-arbitrary-file-read-vulnerability-in-yelp-cve-2025-3155/), hence why we don't do that.
  - `gnome-help` v49.0 doesn't work with Help section of our GTK AppImages for some reason, while older versions, like v42.3 work.
